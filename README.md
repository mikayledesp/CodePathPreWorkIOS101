## App Brainstorming (Step 4)


Prompt : Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps

1) Tumblr 
- Tumblr swithing up their app icon every so often is one of my favortie features on the app!
- Tumblr having the choice of round or square icons which adds a nice customizational touch.
- Tumblr having a tags feature where you can fiter out your feed based on the types of media you want to interact with at that moment.  

2) Instagram 
- The instagram explore page has a very satisfying and addicting layout to keep users hooked. 
- Instagram's ease when it comes to changing the account your on is a very speedy and quick feature.

3) Netflix
- The carrosel in the home portion of the app that allows user to browse a huge variety of content.
- The video preview netflix allows when you to watch as you hover over media titles. 


Prompt : Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

An app I dea I would love to build is one where the user can simultanously scroll on a variety of media like Netflix while also being able to see the response from the community. I would also add the feature  to view other member's profile plus their favorite shows or movies would help add more community to the user base. 



## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
